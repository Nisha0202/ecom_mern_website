The website ’Burger Bro’ is a small online food cart where people can order their favorite burgers and get them delivered to their door in minutes. It is designed to make ordering easy. 
The features we worked to achieve on our website:
Responsiveness: The website is developed using a mobile-first approach. It is responsive, which means it adapts to any screen size and device. Whether customers are using a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, they can browse the menu, customize their order, login or logout easily.
Color palette: The website uses a warm and appetizing color palette that reflects the brand identity and the delicious burgers. It uses shades of orange, yellow, black and white to create a minimalistic, cozy, and inviting atmosphere for customers.
Cart: The cart system allows customers to add multiple items to their order, change the quantity, and remove items as they wish. They can also see the total price of their order, confirm their order and check out easily. 
Signup and login: To order from the website, customers need to create an account or log in with their existing one. This way, they can save their personal information, delivery address, and payment methods for future orders. They can also view their order history.
Auth token: The website uses an auth token system to ensure the security and privacy of the customers’ accounts. An auth token is a unique code that identifies them as valid users and grants them access to the services. They don’t need to worry about remembering their password or entering it every time they log in. The website will generate and store an auth token for them automatically when they sign up or log in and they can be logged in with a password until they have logged out themselves.
Admin access: Admin can access a specific page where you can manage the orders, and settings of our website. Admin can update delivery status as needed. To access the admin dashboard, admin needs to log in with admin credentials that we will provide you. 
Easy Search option: Users can search for their preferable thing to find burgers faster from the menu. It's easy, convenient and fast.
